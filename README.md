# PowerCellDetection2020
This repository is for detecting power cells with vision processing using the raspberry pi. This project uses OpenCV to isolate
the power cells and detect them using the microsoft lifecam. This project will calculate the distance from the robot to the power cell
it detects and will send that information to the robot using NetworkTables.
